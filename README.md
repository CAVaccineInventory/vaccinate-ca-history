Tracking changes made to the data in the www.vaccinateca.com API

This repository fetches the latest data from the API every ten minutes and creates a new commit if something has changed.

This acts as yet another data backup, and means the [recent commits page]() acts as a timeline showing exactly what changed when.

See [Generating a commit log for San Franciscoâ€™s official list of trees](https://simonwillison.net/2019/Mar/13/tree-history/) for background on how this works.
